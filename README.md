## Brief Summary: 
ARt App is a web application inspired by the likes of Instagram, Tumbler, Pinterest, etc. It was a three-week project to mark the end of my time at the Flatiron Software Development Bootcamp. The project enables users to share images with another through follower/following relationships and likes. It provides two non-standard view mediums for images: on a 3D canvas and an AR viewer. To make it easier for users to connect, users can preview other users' likes/follows and create their relationships from these views.

## Installation:
* First, clone the project directory

  ### Backend Steps:
  * cd into folder 'backend'
  * run 'bundle install'
  * run 'rails db:create'
  * Note: if using WSL you may need to run 'sudo service postgresql start' prior to 'rails db:create'
  * If you want demo users/posts/comments/relationships run 'rails db:seed'
  * run 'rails s' to run the backend server

  ### Frontend Steps
  * cd into folder 'frontend'
  * run 'npm i'
  * run 'npm start'
  * agree when prompted to run on port 3001
  * you can now access the web app locally at: http://localhost:3001/
