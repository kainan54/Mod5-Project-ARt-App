Project Title: ARt APP

Description:
ARt App is a web application inspired by the likes of Instagram, Tumbler,  Pinterest, etc. It was a three-week project to mark the end of my time at the Flatiron Software Development Bootcamp. The project enables users to share images with another through follower/following relationships and likes. It provides two non-standard view mediums for images: on a 3D canvas and an AR viewer. To make it easier for users to connect, users can preview other users' likes/follows and create their relationships from these views.
